# spring-jms-mq
Springboot sample to work with JMS using IBM MQ as the MQ provider

This uses the sample at http://ciruk.pl/2017/01/testing-jms-bridge-to-ibm-mq-with-spring-boot/ as the basis.

This uses a number of components and we need to keep it simple and reduce all the dependencies to the bare minimum.
